/****  ELEMENTAL WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS ****

FIRE
-----
Naturally, fire is a powerful offensive magic that can be employed in almost any battle.
Torches can be lit, and fires can be started on dry tinder.
Beware that once a fire gets started it can move unpredictably, and does not discriminate.
Fire heals Fire Elementals.
Fire is especially effective against Frost Elementals.




WATER
------
Water damages enemies via blunt impact force.
Water can be used tactically to knock enemies over and even soak them to increase
their carry weight (or your own, should you wish).
Water can be used outside of battle to put out torches, or extinguise fires that may
block your path.
Water is most effective against fire elementals, dealing great damage, almost certainly
wiping them out in one hit.
Water has no effect on Water Elementals.
Water, being blunt damage, is very effective against undead, and can be blessed to make it
holy water for even further damage.




ICE
----
Ice can be used offensively as piercing damage.
Ice can be used to slow enemy movement and dexterity. An enemy will begin to warm up if not kept
cold or if they're near a source of heat.
Ice can freeze enemies solid. Frozen enemies can't move, defend, and are weak against blunt damage.
Ice and cold do no harm to Fire Elementals as their heat simply vaporises ice instantly.
Ice is very effective at freezing water elementals solid, and a simple bash should destroy them.
Ice heals Frost Elementals.



ELECTRIC
---------
Electricity is good for dealing damage to multiple enemies at a time (chain lightning).
Enemies can be shocked. Shocked enemies can't move, fight or defend themselves.

EFFECTS
=======
(~) = subject to modifiers



COLD
-----
Gives target a number of cold tokens equal to the spell level.

Rules:
  Every turn an entity warms up towards their natural warmth level.
  Cold affected entities are given cold tokens. The more tokens, the more severe the effects on stats.
  Cold tokens are cumulative, so you can keep blasting an enemy with a cold inducing spell and the effects are amplified.
  When an entity has lost all movement they become frozen.

Cold token rules:
  -1 dexterity for every 1 token
  -1 movement for every 3 tokens
  e.g. A level 6 cold spell would isntantly give -6 to dexterity and -2 to move.(~)
       3 tokens would be -3 dex, -1 move speed
       2 tokens would be -2 dex, -0 move speed




FREEZE
------
Prevents all actions.
Massively increases weakness to blunt damage.
Frozen entities are frozen for a number of turns equal to the level of the effect(~).

Rules:
  Every turn, frozen entities lose 1 freeze token.
  Entities that become unfrozen still suffer from cold tokens and will be slower and less dexterous.
  The die size is equal to the level of shock effect (probably the same level as the causing spell).
  The die size is further modified by resistances and bonuses, etc.
  Rolling the max number will end the shock.
  Every turn the max number is reduced by 1 (depending on modifiers).



SHOCK
------
Prevents all actions.

Rules:
  Shocked entities roll every turn to see if they are still shocked.
  The die size is equal to the level of shock effect (probably the same level as the causing spell)(~).
  Rolling the max number will end the shock.
  Every turn the max number is reduced by 1 (depending on modifiers).
